During the trial I was able to achieve results that before I deemed impossible because of my focus on my job and family. The integration with Anny and the signal providers made my tradings 100% automated, bringing me confort and peace of mind. Thanks to the whole team for bringing Anny to life in the crypto world!",
          "jaqueline": "Anny is simply amazing! When I started to user her I was completely iliterate about bots and that didn't stop me from loving her ü•∞. The artificial inteligence makes her self explanatory and really easy to use on day trading, she manages the signals, let you set your own strategy in accordance with the market moment in crypto trading. With all this technology I have more time to study, perfom my analysis, leisure and much more. I hope you try her and allow her to become as indipensable to you as she is to me. üòâ",
          "brunogama": "Anny is a mega ally for the trader. With her, you'll have more time to enjoy family and friends. She brings a priceless peace of mind! And the possibility to integrate with external signals is amazing. I've been having this experience with the signals from Crypto Investidor and it's been perfect.",
          "alvaro": "An incredible tool for inexperient traders because it's level of automation is amazing. It's equally useful for experient traders because you can create your own signal and allow her to monitor everything, from stop loss to trailing stop and automatic sell. I really like to use it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thanks to the great team of developers for bringing Anny to life, it's a guaranteed success.",
          "wagnerjr": "After testing many bots to achieve the dream of automated trading I can say that Anny without doubt is the bot that has been achieving this dream with most efficiency. I've been using Anny for months to manage every burden of day trading. Today I do 100% of my trades using my phone, from anywhere and I have Anny managing everything and keeping me informed of everything at all times. And I mean everything, she buys, sets the stop loss and sells in the way I configured her to proceed. It's really incredible, the best part is the fact that she is there, on Telegram and in the palm of my hands bringing me practicality and complete efficiency. I really improved my results leaving Anny in charge and without my emotions on the way! Congratulations to everyone involved in Anny's project, she is simply amazing, thank you! I recommend to anyone.",
          "andregontijo": "What to say about a bot that has artificial intelligence and works for me while I'm working, sleeping, taking a shower or even when my phone is off? That's only possible with Anny! Anny and all her functionalities have been making me really happy with the results I've been getting. Big thanks to everyone involved in Anny's project, this project can really change the financial life of people! Anny I love you!"
